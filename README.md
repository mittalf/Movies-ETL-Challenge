# Movies-ETL-Challenge
Movies ETL Challenge

## Project Overview:

### Background:

Amazing Prime Video (APV) is a platform for streaming video and tv shows on amazing prime, the wolrd's largest retailer. They want to develop an algorithm to predict which low budget movies being released will become popular, so they can buy the streaming rights for a bargain and have decided to sponsor a Hackathon, providing a clean dataset of movie data  and asking participants to predict the popular  pictures.

Task is to create the dataset for the Hackathon.  There are 2  datasources - a scrape a wikepedia for all movies released since 1990's and rating data from movies land website.  

- extract the data from the two sources,  
- transform it into one clean dataset and 
- load that dataset into a SQL table 

### Purpose:

Create an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables. Refactor the code from this module to create one function that takes in the three files—Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data - and then perform the ETL process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database.

• Create ETL Function to Read Three Data Files
• Extract and Transform the Wikipedia Data
• Extract and Transform the Kaggle data
• Create the Movie Database

## Resources:

Kaggle data 
wikipedia-movies data

Software: Python 3.6.1, Pandas, Matplotlib 3.3.4, PostgreSQL, pgAdmin, Jupyter notebook, Anaconda, Visual Source code. Anaconda "PythonData" development environment was created for this project.
